# Code Challenge 6

**Assignment**
Extend on your LinkedList implementation by adding three new methods.

    Append: This method takes a new value as an argument and adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list.

    InsertBefore: This method takes two arguments, "value" and "newValue". It adds a new node with the given "newValue" immediately before the first node that has the value specified by "value".

    InsertAfter: This method also takes two arguments, "value" and "newValue". It adds a new node with the given "newValue" immediately after the first node that has the value specified by "value".
